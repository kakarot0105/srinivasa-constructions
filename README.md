# Srinivasa Constructions & Civil Works

This repository contains the initial scaffold for the **Srinivasa Constructions & Civil Works** digital platform.  The goal of this project is to give the business a modern web presence and a companion mobile application for real‑time project communication with clients.

## Repository structure

```
srinivasa_constructions/
├─┐ web/        # Static website front‑end (HTML/CSS)
├─┐ app/        # Mobile app prototype (React Native)
├─┐ backend/    # Node/Express API server for data persistence
└── README.md   # Project overview and instructions
```

### `web/`

The website is built using plain HTML and CSS to keep things lightweight.  It features:

- **Navigation and hero section** – introduces the company and directs visitors to key sections.
- **About** – provides company history and mission.
- **Services** – outlines core offerings such as building construction, infrastructure development and project management.
- **Project portfolio** – placeholder grid where you can showcase completed projects with photos and descriptions.  Good portfolios include high‑quality images, project details, timelines and client testimonials【800952981677271†L246-L274】.
- **Contact form** – allows visitors to submit inquiries or request quotes.  Multiple contact options and quote request forms are recommended to improve lead generation【800952981677271†L388-L396】.

To preview the site locally, open `index.html` in your browser.

### `backend/`

The backend is a minimal Node/Express server with placeholder endpoints.  The intention is to provide:

* A **task/progress API** so that site updates can be recorded and retrieved.  This will later feed both the website (for administrator use) and the client portal.
* User authentication (to be implemented) for staff and clients.
* In‑memory data storage initially; replace with a database such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB in production.

### `app/`

This directory contains a minimal React Native app scaffold (`App.js`).  It demonstrates how the mobile client might:

* Allow clients to **log in** to view their project status.
* Display a **dashboard** with project progress, tasks, photos and documents.
* Send **messages** to the project manager.

To run the app, install [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev) and run `npx expo start` from within the `app` folder.  This requires Node JS and a recent version of npm installed on your development machine.

## Suggested features (Web & Mobile)

* **Responsive design**: further refine the front‑end for different screen sizes.
* **Domain & hosting**: after selecting a domain, deploy the website and backend using a cloud provider.

This scaffold is just the beginning; it provides a clean starting point for building a professional digital presence for Srinivasa Constructions & Civil Works.
